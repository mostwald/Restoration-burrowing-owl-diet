# Abstract
Recovering biodiversity across trophic levels is a major challenge in restoration ecology. Specifically, predator populations depend on the timely reestablishment of their preferred prey species in restored lands. Here, we evaluate potential ecological factors contributing to the loss of western burrowing owls (*Athene cunicularia hypugaea* (Bonaparte, 1825)) from a newly restored coastal grassland. We examined owl pellets and found that burrowing owl diets were relatively low in vertebrate prey during their brief occupation of the restoration site (2.6% of prey items; found in 61.8% of sampled pellets). Because vertebrate prey availability can influence reproductive success of burrowing owls, we suggest that preferred food limitation may have contributed to the loss of owls from the restoration site. These findings emphasize the need to consider reestablishment of prey communities for effective long-term recovery of raptor species in restored landscapes.

# Repository Directory
## Code: Contains code for data analysis in R
Melissodes-water-loss-analysis.R: In this document, we analyze predictors of water loss in _Melissodes tepidus timberlakei_ females, including: social condition, initial mass, activity level, and the interaction between social condition and activity level.

## Data: Contains the raw water loss data and accession numbers for vouchered specimens
Owl Pellet Data Dec2023.csv: In this document, we present the raw data collected during pellet dissection. The column headings should be interpreted as follows:

siteID = A unique identifier given to the hibernaculum from which the pellets were collected

dateCollected = The date of pellet collection

pelletLength = The length of pellets in ___INSERT UNITS____

pelletDryMass = The mass in grams of the dried pellets

pelletID = The unique catalog number given to each pellet, deposited in the University of California, Santa Barbara Natural History Collections

species = The lowest possible taxonomic assignment for each identified prey item (may be species, genus, or family)

genus = The genus of the prey item, where known (otherwise, the family)

numberOfIndividuals = The estimated number of individuals per pellet per taxonomic group

vertOrInvert = A designation of whether the prey item is a vertebrate or an invertebrate
